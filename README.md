# jupyterNotebooks

I'm learning to use Jupyter notebooks and I'll be placing some of them here as I learn.  Thus far I've gotten Python, PHP and JavaScript kernels working (which are really all I want to work on currently).  Feel free to use these notebooks or view them using the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" target="_blank">NBViewer</a>.
